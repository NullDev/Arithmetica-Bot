<hr>
<br><br>
This counting bot allows arithmetic expressions instead of just numbers. It supports multiple languages, a configurable timeout for losers, toggleable arithmetic and a cheat mode where you can't lose. It also takes care of deleted counts and prevents the same user from counting twice in a row.<br><br>
